# STARTUPS-PROFIT-PREDICTION
In the dynamic landscape of entrepreneurship, predicting the success and 
profitability of startups remains a critical pursuit for investors, stakeholders, and 
entrepreneurs alike. The 50-startups dataset stands as a valuable resource in this 
endeavor, offering a wealth of information encompassing various features that 
potentially influence a startup's profitability.
Utilizing the principles of Multiple Linear Regression, this study aims to 
leverage the dataset's diverse set of factors – such as R&D spending, marketing 
expenditures, administration costs – to construct a predictive model for the profit margins of these startups.
